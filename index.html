            <h1>What it is?</h1>

            <p>Soil pollution happens when toxic substances are discharge in the natural soil environment, causing problems for different types of lives. Daily, we can see this problem in the food we eat, the regular use of chemical fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers, pesticides will decrease the fertility of the soil at a rapid rate and alter the structure of the soil. This will lead to decrease in soil quality and poor quality of crops.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.fao.org/home/en" target="_blank">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a>, the regions affected the most are Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>

            <h2>What causes?</h2>

            <p>The major causes of current soil degradation: problems in sewage systems, garbage accumulation, fertilizers and pesticides.</p>

            <p>There are two types of soil pollution: specific and widespread.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific:</strong> accounted for by particular causes, occurring in small areas the reasons for which can be easily identified. Land pollution such as this is normally found in cities, old factory sites, around roadways, illegal dumps and sewage treatment stations.</p>

            <p><strong>Widespread:</strong> covers extensive areas and has several causes the reasons for which are difficult to identify. Cases such as these involve the spreading of pollutants by air-ground-water systems and seriously affect human health and the environment.</p>

            <h2>deforestation</h2>

            <p><strong>Deforestation</strong> is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural, or accidental means. is one of the major sources of soil pollution.</p>

            <p>Effects of deforestation on the environment <abbr title="In this process, the soil particles are loosened or washed away in the valleys, oceans, rivers, streams or far away lands. This has been worsening due to human activities.">soil erosion</abbr>, climate change and <abbr title="Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, collectively known as drylands, resulting from many factors, including human activities and climatic variations.">desertification</abbr>.</p>

            <p><strong>Deforestation in Brazil:</strong> The Amazon rainforest has been reduced by about 17% since the 1970s. Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Since president Jair Bolsonaro get the power, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage. </p>

                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                <p>Climate change is happening now, and it's the most serious threat to life on our planet. Fortunately, there are plenty of solutions to climate change, they are well-understood.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing carbon emissions</li>
                    <li>Invest in renewable energy</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the use of renewable energy sources</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement" target="_blank">Paris Agreement</a> is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.</p>
